# leaf_disease_detection
Objectives

we have attended consists in training a model using images of the training dataset to
* accurately classify a given image from testing dataset into different diseased category or a healthy leaf;
* accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on a single leaf;
* deal with rare classes and novel symptoms;
* address depth perceptionâ€”angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf;
* Incorporate expert knowledge in identification, annotation, quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant features during learning.

Methods
* Class balancing with SMOTE
* Data augmentation with Keras ImageDataGenerator
* Learning rate schedule
* Optimal dropout
* Epoch grid search
* Visualization of convolutional filters and activation maps of the layers.
